PDF-Cropmarks

This module prepares PDF for printing adding the cropmarks, usually on
a larger physical page, doing the same thing the LaTeX package "crop"
does. It also takes care of the paper thickness, shifting the logical
pages to compensate the folding.

It comes with a ready-made script, pdf-cropmarks.pl
